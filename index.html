			<h1 class="title">About Me</h1>

			<table width=100%>
			<tr valign=top>
			<td><p>I am a physicist, a computational scientist, an inventor, and an educator with a passion to explore how research 
			tools and methods developed and used by scientists and engineers can be harnessed as effective learning 
			tools to meet pressing challenges in science, engineering, and technical education to solve critical social and environmental problems. 
			As research and education share the same goal of understanding how the world works and finding solutions to build a better world, 
			there is no reason that a research tool cannot be used to educate, inspire, and empower people. 
			For example, infrared imaging is a compelling demonstration of how an advanced technology developed by the industry
			to solve engineering problems can be harnessed as an effective learning technology to solve educational
			problems. Computational physics provides digital representations of natural phenomena by solving their 
			governing equations numerically. Computational science is also key to creating artificial intelligence that advances 
			personalized learning, the number one among the fourteen grand challenges for engineering in the 21st century as 
			identified by the National Academy of Engineering of the United States. To some extent, my research and development respond to this important call.
			<br><br>
			At present, I am working in four different directions concurrrently: 
			artificial intelligence, cyber-physical systems, visual analytics, and energy science, 
			funded mostly by the National Science Foundation of the United States.
			Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in collaboration.

			<h4>Infrared Street View Comes into Sight</h4>
			<p>(July 9, 2019) The National Science Foundation <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1712676">awarded us $500,000</a> in 2018 to 
			explore possibilities to crowdsource the Infrared Street View through a citizen science project that aims to promote science education and raise 
			public awareness of energy efficiency. Through more than a year of research and development, I have moved this vision closer to reality.
			The screenshot image to the right shows the Infrared Street View rendered on a smartphone. The app can also be used by anyone to make such panoramic street views.

			<h4>Digital Twins Born</h4>
			<p>(March 14, 2019) Digital twin technology is the core of cyber-physical systems that drive Industry 4.0. I have started tapping into the potential of using digital
			twins to create a development platform that aims to simplify the learning and application of the Internet of Things (IoT) to bring its power to more people. A digital
			twin of the Rainbow HAT (hardware attached to the top) for the Raspberry Pi has been created in the cloud to enable real-time state synchronization over the air.

			<h4>Project Snake Eyes Launched</h4>
			<p>(August 22, 2018) Project Snake Eyes aims to combine image analysis and infrared imaging to create biomimetic thermal vision &mdash; 
			computer vision that simulates the ability of some animals such as snakes to see in darkness. 
			One of the goals of Project Snake Eyes is to create probably the world's first robotic snake that can hunt through thermal sensing. Project Snake Eyes 
			not only can detect heat, but it can also estimate the size and proximity of the source, giving the robotic snake the artificial intelligence to figure out whether or not it should 
			strike the target. This technology has many applications in science and engineering.

			<h4>Artificial Intelligence Comes to Energy3D</h4>
			<p>(July 4, 2018) Based on an engine of evolutionary computation I built, Energy3D is now one of the most accessible generative design tools for students, teachers, and engineers to
			imagine how future of work at the human-technology frontier in the field of engineering and education will be transformed by the power of artificial intelligence (AI). The possibilities created
			by AI for engineering and education are now limited only by our imagination. Intense research and development are now under way in my lab to unveil this transformative power. For more information,
			see <a href="https://medium.com/@charlesxie/using-artificial-intelligence-to-design-a-solar-farm-f25f94b42691">my blog article</a> about how AI can outsmart human in designing a solar farm.

			<a href="http://molecularworkbench.blogspot.com/2013/09/national-science-foundation-funds.html">awarded us $1.5 million</a>
			to advance educational research on engineering design using computational process analytics based on big data. This study
			will probably be the largest-scale study on engineering design in the history of engineering education 
			&mdash; Approximately 3,000 students will be involved in 6-8 hours of intense design projects using our Energy3D software, 
			producing about 60 GB of process data that will become the "gold mine" of educational research.

			keynote speech at the Opening Plenary of 
			<a href="http://www.inframation.org/">InfraMation</a>, the world's largest conference on infrared imaging. 
			I presented several original scientific discoveries based on IR imaging, 
			proposed the concept of educational imaging, and suggested business strategies for the education market. 
			The presentation was very well received.
			I was glad to see that my contributions to applied IR imaging had been recognized by the industry.

			<h4>From Virtual to Real</h4>
			<p>(April 28, 2012) <a href="http://energy3d.concord.org">Energy3D</a>, featured at 2012 USA Science and Engineering Festival, 
			is our signature software tool for designing and making scale-model buildings. 
			A cool feature of the program is that students can print out their computer models, cut the pieces out, and then assemble them into 
			physical models. In the future, we hope to integrate this tool with digital fabricators that use additive manufacuring technologies to
			accelerate the conversion.
