<h5><i>A simple molecular dynamics program and some thinkings about free
energy calculations</i></h5>

<p>This program was designed to investigate the state-of-the-art approaches
for free energy calculations, based on the Lennard-Jones interatomic
interaction model. The program is supposed to do the following things:

<ul>
<li>Implement thermodynamical integration (TI) free energy calculation
for a single atom mutation in a Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluid;
<li>Implement the adiabatic switching (AS) and reversible scaling (RS) 
technique;
<li>Implement the competitive lambda dynamics approach for screening
the best bound atom to certain thermal environment;
<li>Lattice dynamics and phonon spectrum calculation for obtaining
the reference free energy near absolute zero temperature;
</ul>

<p>By playing with this program, one can understand some basic
concepts in free energy calculations using the MD method which are 
otherwise buried
in the complexity of protein structures and the force fields.
Special effort is made on checking the effectiveness of
the competitive lambda dynamics for such a simple model. 
Due to time limitation, I only did
free energy calculations for the formation of an impurity in a
pure system. My
conclusions based on these benchmarking calculations can be summarized
as follows (Of course I could be wrong):

<ul>
<li>With an appropriate switching function and switch time,
the results given by the RS method are in good agreement with
those by the TI method, however, in the high temperature regime
above the melting point, disagreement becomes more 
and more obvious. This could be due to the fact that the system
enters the superheated regime and the free energy change through
a superheating route is different from the free energy difference
between thermodynamically equilibrated states.

<li><a href="paper/as01.ps">Comparison of free energy results using different methods</a>
</ul>

<li>I believe there are some theoretical issues with the lambda
dynamics approach implemented in Charmm V.27 that need to be cleared. I
remain skeptical that that version of the lambda dynamics (LD)
had been tested enough. The major question I came up with the
simulations for a simple LJ fluid is that the introduction of the
Langrange multipler would eventually kill all the other competitors
and lead to the result that only the champion 
can survive after a very long time simulation. 
<i>Consider the fact that nothing in the equations of motion could stop
the (two) finalists from competing with each other if we run the simulation
for longer time. No matter how weak the energy difference could be, it
will sort the rivals out eventually, given adequately long time, just
like fluids will flow as long as there exists a <b>net</b> chemical 
gradient. Therefore,
theoretically speaking, the equation of motion in the LD might not
be suitable for the computation of free energy differences---remember
the Gibbs postulate about the ergodicity hypothesis, if the equation
of motion leads clearly to a final state, it is non-ergodic and therefore
any free energy calculation sampling based on this nonequilibrium 
time ensemble becomes problematical. Conservatively speaking, the LD
method serves well in finding the best ligand, but it is doubtful that
it can be used to figure out the free energy differences in its present
form.</i>
Removal of the multipler (i.e. the second-order constraint)
seems to put them back, however, it is not preferrable as the holonomic
constraint usually requires the Langrange factor.
This question seems to have put me on hold. As the energy landscape of a
LJ system is much more ruggedless than that of a complicated protein-ligand 
setting, the system should in principle be more mobile in the phase space.
This could be the reason that we see all the other components die off
after a long time. In a protein-ligand simulation setting, as the energy
landscape is far more rugged, it might not be easy for the ligands to die
off in the lambda dynamics. This could have two completely different
implications: One is that the lambda dynamics is fine as it
might be the case in reality; The other is that the lambda dynamics is
misleading before the system has explored enough of the phase space (as
the method claims that it is able to rapidly screen the most favorable
ligand out of a bunch, this is of particular importance).
<li>The LD method, with appropriate modifications, 
can be applied to a number of problems in 
materials simulations, for instance, surface chemisorption, 
solid solutions, and phase stabilities of alloys. In surface physics,
what kind of surface can bind what kind of gas molecules is a hot
topic, as the problem is believed important for example to car depollution 
research. By constructing hybrid gas molecules and applying the LD method,
we can rapidly screen which type of molecule will bind to a given 
(relaxed and reconstructed) metallic surface the most easily. In composite
materials research, it is also important to investigate the phase stabilities
of alloys. For example, suppose we want to have a B2 alloy which must be
composed of metal Cu, and we then need to know which metal can form a B2
structure with a given lattice constant with Cu. The LD approach stands for
a novel method of doing this---We build a hybrid atom which consists of
different components of Au, Bi, Fe and so on, put this hybrid atom on one
of the two vertices in the B2 structure, and the LD will tell us which metal
is prefered. This work has been partly done: With a Lennard-Jones potential
model, the LD method is clearly capable of picking up the most stable phase.

<h5><i>A tight-binding electron transfer program</i></h5>

<p>A simple playground program for electron transfer dynamics
on the tight-binding model can be found <a href="et">here</a>.
With this program, the user can play simple tight-binding model,
do two-state and three-state reductions, and check the two-state
and three-state approximations for simple models, and perhaps
get some intuition out of them. Here are
some postscript figures: (1)<a href="paper/et_DA_distance.ps">
Electron dynamics with different donor-accept distances</a>; 
(2)<a href="paper/et_bridge_frequency.ps">
Electron dynamics when the bridge frequency is different</a>.

<p>I would like to point out here that the multi-state reduction
may be an interesting problem. But we have not been able to explore
more with it. It is mentionworthy that the multi-state resonance
might be nontrivial in some circumstance. Multiple state resonances
are usually more difficult to find, dynamical multiple state resonances
are even harder to detect. But can we rule out the possibility of 
multiple state resonances and their contributions to extraordinary
electron transfer?
For details, read a <a href="paper/msr.ps">short note</a>.

<h5><i>The  Floquet  program</i></h5>

<p>We have spent efforts on exploring the applicability of the Floquet
formulism to the electron transfer problem, and eventually came up
with the conclusion after a thorough discussion with Professor David
Beratan that it might not be relevant to the biological electron
transfer problem. However, the Floquet picture is still helpful in
understanding electron propogation behavior through a dynamical
bridge. Hence it might be useful
to present the program we have written here.

<p>We present three interesting results which were produced using
this program. The results are about the electron dynamics on a three-state
system with the middle state vibrating. 
The <a href="paper/3s_frequencydependence.ps">first figure</a>
shows the dependence of the propogation on the bridge frequency.
The <a href="paper/3s_gapdependence.ps">second figure</a>
shows the dependence of the propogation on the barrier height.
The <a href="paper/3s_quasi.ps">third figure</a>
shows quasienergy spectrum of the dynamical system.

<p>Trivially, I should add that the time evolution produced by the
Floquet propogator is in exact agreement with that given by the
predictor-corrector time integrator. This serves as a double check
for our code.

<p>Subroutine <code><a href="floquet/linux/floquet.f">floquet.f</a></code>
constructs the Floquet matrix. <a href="floquet/hpux">HP-UX version</a> and 
<a href="floquet/linux">Linux version</a>
