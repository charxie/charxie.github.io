<h4>The effective two-state approximation</h4>

<a name="construct">
<h5><i>Construct the two-state Hamiltonian</i></h5>

We have known three levels of two-state approximation for
electron transfer: Larsson's perturbative approximation (LPA), 
two renormalized eigenstates approximation (TREA), and two exact
eigenstates approximation (TEEA). The latter two are nonperturbative
approximations. The TEEA explains the validity of the
empirical TREA, which performs much better than does the LPA in
approximating the time-dependent electronic dynamics.

<p>The reason that the LPA doesn't work is obvious. Because the
time Green functions is the integration of the Schroedinger equation
of motion therefore a time cumulative, 
the LPA result will certainly disagree more and more
with the exact ones as the propogation goes, since the
perturbative results always have more or less deviations from the
exact ones that will sooner or later have amplified influence to an 
important amount in a time cumulative no matter how small it might have 
been. In my opinion, changing <i>E<sub>tunneling</sub></i> to get
a series of <i>T<sub>DA</sub></i> that could reproduce the exact
propogation is theoretically not right, because it is theoretically
right to have higher order deviations.

<a name="signal">
<h5><i>A signal processing point of view of the two-state approximation</i></h5>

<p>The process of constructing a TSA which is valid for describing
the electronic dynamics of a system with large dimension resembles
retrieving a signal from a background of noise. In our theory, the
interested 'signal' is the superexchange part of electron current
(or the tunneling current), the 'noise' is the transport-like part
which inevitably arises from the multisite hopping.

<p><b>The question is, does the TSA thus constructed
continue to be legitimate when the 'signal' gets weaker and weaker than the 
'noise'?</b> We know that in weak coupling cases, it is the weak one of the D
and A characters that plays the decisive role on deriving the TSA.
Suppose, in an extreme case, that the contributions from the 'heat bath',
namely, the wave function scatterings from the bridge sites to the D and
A states, constitute 99% of the whole character, do we believe that we
would still be able to restore the 1% 'signal' from such a noisy background?

<p>Perhaps yes. But an ensemble average point of view must enter our sight.

<p>Perhaps no. Because the 'signal' is simply too weak to be restored.
