<h4>Transformation to the Natural Bond Orbitals</h4>

<p>The Natural Bond Orbitals (NBOs) refer to a set of bonding and
antibonding orbitals that are automatically constructed from 
self consistent field (SCF) quantum mechanical calculations. Because
chemical bond orbitals are localized in nature, the electron density
matrix may be localized as well. It is possible that the
bond orbitals can be derived from diagonalizing the subblocks of
the (SCF converged) density matrix.

<p>The original version of the BONDO is unable to treat delocalized
bonds, though it can construct three-center bonds. The major problem
of the BONDO method is that, despite of the fact that it can find
three bonding orbitals with almost full electronic occupancies, and three
antibonding orbitals with almost empty occupancies, from diagonalizing 
the density matrix
subblock that includes all the six atoms of an aromatic ring, the
orbitals thus produced are usually linear combinations of the well-defined
<i>pi</i> orbitals that chemists like to see, instead of just being them.
Numerically speaking, this type of mix-up of eigenstates is due to the
occupancy degeneracy: Three bonding eigenstates of the 6-center
density matrix
subblock are degenerate, and the other three (antibonding) eigenstates
are degenerate. The degeneracy problem does not exist for a bi-center 
subblock if there is only a sigma single bond. But if there is a double
bond, we will have two degenerate eigenstates. In the latter case, we
will have to transfer the problem to the Fock matrix space. By diagonalizing
the sub Fock matrix, the two orbitals of the double bond can then be 
distinguished.

<p>Unfortunately, 
transfering subblock diagonalization from the density matrix space
to the Fock matrix space does not solve the problem for aromatic rings
because in the
energy eigenspace, we will encounter the energy degeneracy problem:
Two out of the three bonding eigenstates are energetically degenerate,
and two out of the three antibonding eigenstates are degnerate too.
(Spiros
had suggested that by combination of density matrix and Fock matrix
subblock diagonalizations, we might be able to make it, but it turned
out that I couldn't.)

<p>Although our solution for aromatic rings is not a 'natural' one,
namely, bonds are not generated 'naturally' like what the BONDO
does for other bonds, it is a natural combination of 'unnatural'
bonds with 'natural' ones.

<h5><i>The subroutines</i></h5>

<p>The NBO transformation was implemented originally
with the CNDO code in the BONDO program, <b>and has been implemented
in our group with the EH code</b>.

<p><a href="bondo/hpux">HP-UX version</a> and
<a href="bondo/linux">Linux version</a> for the modified BONDO program
are provided. The HP-UX version makes use of the BLAS library that
comes with the HP-UX workstation. In the Linux version, the Strassen
method for matrix multiplication is used.
The <a href="bondo/hpux/input_lcbo"><code>input_lcbo</code></a> sets
the flags for CNDO calculations on the NBO basis (also called 
the Linear Combination of Bond Orbitals method).

<h5><i>How to handle aromatic rings</i></h5>

The original subroutine for constructing orthogonal matrix
transformation from atomic orbitals (AO) to bond orbitials (BO),
<code>NATHYB</code> in BONDO, was replaced by an aromatic-ring-capable
subroutine, <code>aromatic</code>.

<p>Having read an input PDB structure, the program detects whether
or not there exist benzene molecules (BENZ), tryptophan, tyrosine, 
and phenylalanine
in the system. If yes, flags <code>aring</code> true, and deposits the
index of the six carbon atoms into the array <code>idc6(i,nring)</code>.
The maximum number of aromatic rings allowed is 20, as declared in the
common block for <code>idc6</code>. The following snippet describes 
how this is done.

<p>In order to construct the delocalized aromatic <i>pi</i> bonds,
all the hybrid orbitals have to be known. Before excuting the snippet
that does the job for aromatic rings, the program has already searched
and established all the lone pairs and two-center bonds. Therefore,
up to now, every carbon atom of an aromatic ring has three known <i>sp2</i>
atomic hybrids that form the bonds with two nearby carbon atoms and
the dangling hydrogen atom. By use of the orthonormality conditions, the
fourth atomic orbital can be reconstructed from these three known 
hybrids. Subroutine <code>fourth</code> is to do this job. If the print
level <code>ipr</code> is greater than 3, it will also check if the
reconstructed orbital is strictly orthogonal to the three parent orbitals.
The reconstructed orbitals are deposited in the array <code>Q</code>,
together with the hybrids and lonepairs. The subroutine 
<code>REFORMaro</code> is used to construct the aromatic part of the
<code>T</code> matrix:

In the above code snippet, the magenta lines define the prefactors
of linear combinations for the <i>pi</i> bonds and antibonds, 
<code>cop</code>. The blue lines build the <i>pi</i> bonds, 
namely, the linear combinations of
the renormalized atomic hybrids obtained by <code>fourth</code>.

<p>A plot that shows success of the above scheme can be found 
<a href="paper/bond.ps">here</a>. The average MO energies corresponding
to the aromatic ring exhibit convincing degeneracy, proving that
the aromatic ring is still chemically an aromatic ring in the protein
environment. (Another sign that the CHARMM force field is capable of
maintaining the chemical stability of proteins.)

<h5><i>Dedegenerating double bonds and lone pairs</i></h5>

We found extraordinarily large fluctuations of direct couplings
of C=O double bonds and O lone pairs with others
(a frequently encountered case 
in amino acids calculations) when analyzing the time series of the 
Hamiltonian matrix elements (This has, mistakenly, led to what Spiros
calls the electronic pumping phenonmenon, which serves as an example
that ultrafast and ultra-intensive electronic state fluctuations
could result in unusual transport-like behavior).

<p>The cause of such (false) fluctuations became clear later on: They
are caused by the population degeneracy of the two orbitals in the doube 
bonds and lone pairs. The two eigenstates obtained by diagonalizing
the density matrix subblocks corresponding to these degenerate bonds
are, in actuality, sort of random mixture of the two bonding orbitals.
Fluctuations therefore change the couplings of
these false bonds with others stochastically, with a magnitude 
comparable up to twice of the absolute values of the couplings.

<p>The effect of these false fluctuations could have been eliminated
had we taken the K matrix into integration. The K matrix will counteract
the role of these false fluctuations when the Schroedinge equation is
integrated. But as we have dropped the K matrix off in the CNDO 
calculations, the false fluctuations would show off their influence
on the electronic dynamics, particularly when they are adjacent to the
donor and acceptor. The consequence is always a gradual and steady rising
of electronic population in the bridge.

<p>Unlike the case of the aromatic rings, a C=O double bond or O lone pair
has two unknown hybrids that are needed to be determined. Obviously,
the condition of orthonormality cannot be used to construct two unknown
hybrids from the other two known ones. Therefore, we have to turn to other
methods to dedegenerate them. 
One of the methods, as Spiros suggested, is to make use of the
energetical nondegeneracy of the bonds. Namely, we transfer the 
determination of the bonds to the Fock space, instead of diagonalizing
the density matrix subblock, we diagonalize the Fock matrix subblock.
Because there is an energy gap between the two states in a double bond,
they can therefore be distinguished. Code: 
<a href="bondo/hpux/cobond.f">C=O double bonds</a> and
<a href="bondo/hpux/lonepair.f">O lone pairs</a>.

<h5><i>Avoid random orbital orientation flipping</i></h5>

A natural bond in the NBO method is represented by a linear combination
of the basis of a Hilbert space spanned by the atomic wave functions 
<i>s, p<sub>x</sub>, p<sub>y</sub>, p<sub>z</sub></i> of all the atoms
involved in the formation of the bond. Although a single chemical bond,
for example, a bicentral bond, has no significant importance for
its interal direction (the direction in which the bond points
from one atom to the other), 
there is a problem of directionality if we have to deal with the
time dependence. 

<br><br>
<center>
<img src="pix/direct.gif"><br>
<font size=2 color="#0000ff"><i>The above two bonds are equivalent, but
their orientations are different.</i></font>
</center>
<br>

In our time dependence simulations on the basis of NBO, 
the wave function basis at each time is reconstructed by diagonalizing
the sub density matrices. The basis, therefore, fluctuates with time.
Such fluctuations result in an electronic friction matrix which enters
the time-dependent Schroedinger equation as an imaginary peer together
with the Hamiltonian. The
magnitude of the friction matrix, numerically, is determined by how
rapidly the basis changes. If the basis varies slowly, then the friction
matrix (sometimes we call the K matrix) can be calculated more accurately.
Due to this reason, we do not hope to see the basis has drastical changes
like arbitary
directional flipping from one state to the other (shown in the above picture).
If, for instance, the bonding directions flip at the rate of one flip
per femtosecond, the situation would amount to having heavy contributions
at the high end of the Fourier spectrum, which <b>disfavors the cubic spline
interpolation method</b> we employ to obtain intermediate Hamiltonians between
flips (cubic splines perform well for smoothly
changing functions but very poor for oscillatory functions).

<p>But does such directional flipping happen in our simulations?

<p>Yes. This problem will be frequently encountered in our simulations.
When we solve the Roothaan equation <i>HC=SCE</i>, there are in principle
two solutions for the eigenvectors <i>C</i> or <i>-C</i>. There is no
criterion which one is more correct. As a convention, the component of
the eigenvector at the first position <i>C(1)</i> is usually assumed to be 
always positive (different diagonalization subroutine may use different
convention, but it should be similiar). In a static calculation, this
is not a problem, because we never need to calculate the time derivative
of the wave functions. In a dynamic calculation, thermal fluctuations can
easily make <i>C(1)</i> change its sign from time to time if its magnitude
is not greater than that of the fluctuations. If all the natural bonds
use this convention to define their directions, we will see some of the
bonds that have small <i>C(1)</i> flipping from time to time.

<p>The solution to such a problem can be described in the following
steps: (1) Select the first Hamiltonian in the time series, build the
natural bonds, and remember the directions of all bonds (store them
in a file <a href="bondo/hpux/tsign"><code>tsign</code></a> or
<a href="bondo/hpux/tsign.hasAromaticRings">
<code>tsign.hasAromaticRings</code></a>), see subroutine
<a href="bondo/hpux/fixsign.f"><code>findsign(n,ipr)</code></a> in
the source file <code>fixsign.f</code>; (2) Build the natural
bonds for successive Hamiltonians, rectify the bond directions according
to the remembered directions (stored in the file <code>tsign</code>), 
see subroutines
<a href="bondo/hpux/fixsign.f"><code>compsign(n,ipr)</code></a>  and 
<a href="bondo/hpux/fixsign.f"><code>compsignaro(n,ipr)</code></a> in
the source file <code>fixsign.f</code>.

The first and second columns are the bond indices and bond codes, listing
bonds (BD), lonepairs (LP) and <i>pi</i> bonds and their antibonds (except
lonepairs). For BD(*)s and LP(*)s, 
from the third to the sixth, the indices and names of atoms
that participate the formation of the bonds are listed. The seventh lists
the positions and signs of the maximum componenents (absolute value, 
of course). The last lists the absolute values of the maximum components.
For PB(*)s, the regulation is slightly distinct. All the six atoms,
their indices, names, positions, signs and values of the maximum components,
are listed as above.

<h5><i>Compute the adiabatic couplings</i></h5>

<p>In CNDO calcullations, we don't calculate the K matrix,
since we neglect the advanced and retarded overlaps as we
have neglected the punctual overlaps. Atomic adiabatic couplings
are calculated within the framework of EH. (See the section
<a href="eh.html">Extended Huckel Calculation</a> for a thorough
description about the calculation method.
